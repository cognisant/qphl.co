The QPHL Community

It must feel like groundhog day. More COVID-19 positive tests every day. Rising numbers of COVID-19 related deaths. Increased travel restrictions, sometimes dislocating families. And now, a return to a form of lockdown across England to deal with this second peak. A peak that was predicted in the Summer, along with another in February next year, but now it seems to some like a surprise. Every one of these reported as a calamity with a long queue of dissenting voices from media pundits and unaccountable politicians. The flip side, the brighter side, never discussed.

I need a light at the end of my tunnel. I am sure you do too.

As a country, we are better equipped to deal with this peak than the first wave of COVID-19, as you would expect, we have learned. We can now do half a million test a day; current demand is for around 300,000. An infection rate below 100:100,000 in Wiltshire is one of the lowest in England and less than half the average. Hospital admission rates are lower than March/April; treatment is more effective. Less than 10% of patients are ventilated, and the average hospital stay is around 7 days. Vaccine trials are progressing rapidly with reports from within and outside the NHS that vaccines may be available for priority groups (vulnerable and healthcare workers) before Christmas.

Whilst risks of infections in the community are heightened, we have implemented best in class measures to maintain a COVID-19 secure workplace. We are all responsible for maintaining these measures through our actions both in and out of our workplace, we must take these seriously. The latest layer of this is the implementation of reactive and surveillance COVID-19 rapid testing within QPHL. As part of Our commitment to you, this will include families. Details will follow shortly.

Our approaches were recently recognized by a Public Health England official who stated: **“I wish GP practices and hospitals were managing this as well as you are&hellip; I’m not sure there's anything we can do to help.”** Well done everyone.

You might ask yourself, why should we do all of this? Why can’t we just go home, sit it out on furlough and wait for it to go away? The answer is simple, our Patients come first. It is the most fundamental part of our Value system and should get us all out of bed every day. If the healthcare system fails to treat people for cancers and chronic diseases, more people will die early from those diseases than will fall to COVID-19. They will be our neighbours and maybe from Our QPHL community.

We also need to do this together, as a community. Across QPHL we have pooled our knowledge, skills and motivation to help us face the dangers that the pandemic exposes us to. I believe we have done this well, it does you all credit. There will surely be more challenging days to come as darker news is reported and probably more cases within QPHL.

It may feel like it will be a long winter. But there is a metaphorical and actual Spring ahead, one that we will share.

P.S. Hands, Face, Space – take it seriously
