Dear all,

As an organisation that supports critical external health services, it is imperative that all of our staff do everything they can to protect themselves from the winter flu. This not only keeps you and your family protected but allows us to continue to offer a flexible and effective service to our customers. This year, more than ever, it is essential we all play our part in protecting Our Community, and we strongly encourage all staff to receive the vaccination.

Without a flu vaccine, if you were to develop symptoms such as a raised temperature or cough, we cannot rule out the possibility that you have contracted COVID-19 and this will result in you, and your family members needing to self-isolate and take a test. This could result in a significant loss of personnel within our companies which would result in us not being able to continue to supply critical medicines and services to patients. Additionally, if you developed symptoms, you may disregard them as flu when you might have COVID-19.

To keep everyone as safe and protected as possible, we are offering all employees and their family members the seasonal flu vaccine free of charge.

The flu vaccine will be administered onsite within the Pharmaxo building (SP1) during September 2020 (dates to be confirmed) by our pharmacy and nursing teams.

If you are on annual leave when the dates are confirmed but would still like the flu vaccine, then please let us know so that alternative arrangements can be made.

Action required by all employees – Please click on the link below and complete your response.
