QPHL Community member,

I am going to state clearly the purpose of this letter and then explain the reasoning behind the policy and how it seeks to protect Our Community, please read the whole letter.

It is our expectation that you will have a COVID-19 vaccine when it is offered to you.

There will be acceptable exceptions from this position. These may include verifiable medical advice to not take a vaccine or a justifiable long held belief associated with a protected characteristic, but they must be discussed and agreed. If you have any reason for not taking the COVID-19 vaccine when offered, or you may have already been offered the vaccine and not taken it, please discuss this with HR as soon as possible.

We have healthcare professionals working in Our Community who have direct contact with the patients we serve. Those patients are by their very nature clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 and it is our responsibility to not infect them or expose them to any greater risk of infection. Where we also have team members who meet other clinical professionals as part of their work, it is our responsibility to not pass infections on. Contact with clinically vulnerable patients, whilst unvaccinated, will become incompatible with our Value system – we are a place Where patients come first.

We see the devastation COVID-19 is wreaking across India and other countries where vaccination rates are low. Here at home, in Bolton and other towns where the so-called Indian variant is dominating, hospitalisations are of those not fully vaccinated.

Set within the context of the global pandemic, the significance of the success of the UK vaccination programme for those the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus cannot be underestimated. For a year, those shielding, and their families, have lived with the prospect that exposure to the virus can lead to the most devastating of consequences. Whether they have chosen to stay at home or attend work, they have lived in hope that vaccines will turn their world the right way up again.

For those who can take the vaccine, whether shielding or not, it affords personal protection against systemic infection. But personal protection is not the sole function of a vaccine. For those who cannot take a vaccine, whether a patient, an employee of the company or a family member, they can only be protected from COVID-19 by herd immunity. Herd immunity is only achieved if we all get vaccinated, and together provide it for them.

Alongside herd immunity for ourselves and our families to enable us to more freely associate, we must also begin considering reverting our workplace to a less strenuous and more socially enriching place to be. Whilst the pandemic has taken a toll on the most vulnerable of those shielding, we do not underestimate the more general impact on the health and wellbeing of Our Community. We must get back to the healthy vibrant workplace that we crave. This requires us, under controlled and risk assessed steps, to begin removing some of our voluntary action under our COVID-19 workplace risk assessment. We must give ourselves to opportunity to remove unwarranted barriers to serving the maximum number of patients and re-enriching Our Community.

We have carefully considered this policy of expecting the vaccine to be taken. We have taken both legal and professional workplace advice. The Executive carefully discussed and debated the implications of adopting such a policy. The main arguments against were libertarian and that the government isn’t making vaccines mandatory so why would we? What is clear, legally, and I would argue ethically and morally, is that we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable whilst providing a workplace safe from the risk of COVID-19 infection balanced with it supporting good health and wellbeing for all of Our Community. The highest possible vaccination rates in Our Community underpins that.

For clarity,

- We are not forcing anyone to have a vaccine. We are simply saying that the risks to our patients, our more vulnerable employees and family members in Our Community are not compatible with remaining unvaccinated without an acceptable exception.
- We do not want anyone to stop working with our team, we have invested and will continue to do so in helping every one of Our Community members understand the risks of COVID-19 and the benefits of vaccines.

If you are reading this having already had your vaccine or clear in your mind you will do so when offered, then you have a made your contribution to our herd immunity and commitment to protecting others. If you have been offered the vaccine and not taken it or are hesitant to do so when it is offered, then I would encourage you to raise this issue with us now. If you have question about vaccines and how they work then we have pharmacists, nurses and scientists who can help. You can also always speak with your Managing Director, me, or HR.

We have circulated materials about vaccines that remain available on our dedicated COVID-19 webpage. If you feel you need an external independent source of information, I have found articles published on The Conversation about COVID-19, written by the scientist researching it, to be particularly readable and informative. Links below.

You will shortly receive details of our own onsite NHS vaccination centre to be run by Pharmaxo. We are opening this to make it easier for you and your families to get vaccinated. We have specifically chosen to administer the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine as it is recommended for younger people who are only just becoming eligible. It will run Thursday, Friday and Saturday on the national booking system. We will be able to administer unused vaccines to you and your colleagues early and can also run extra dedicated sessions for Our Community.

Our efforts over the past year to protect each other and in doing so allowing us to continue serving our patients, over half a million treatments during the pandemic, has been outstanding. You should all feel a great source of pride in having done that.

COVID-19 and its variants will be around for some time yet. Together, we can use the vaccines to build herd immunity for Our Community and in doing so protect each other and ensure we remain a place Where patients come first.

Best Wishes.
