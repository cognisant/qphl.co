Hi all,

The next batch of on-site Covid-19 vaccination appointments (for both 1st and 2nd Pfizer doses) will be released within the next hour.
The appointments will be for the coming week (1st, 2nd and 3rd July).

Please use the link below to book your appointment from 12 midday onwards:

We are also operating a ‘standby list’ to prevent wasting any vaccine at the end of each session (usually between 6.30-8pm weekdays or 4-6pm Saturdays).
If you have local friends or family who need a covid vaccination (Pfizer only) and they can get to site quickly at short notice around the above times, then please pass their details (including contact telephone) on to HR.

Kind regards
