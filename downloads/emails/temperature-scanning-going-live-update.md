Good afternoon, everyone,

As part of our continued work to make sure that QPHL is a COVID-19 secure workplace, we are working through our workplace risk assessment to implement the actions.  As part of this over the next week we will be implementing temperature scanning in all building receptions.

- SP3 will commence from Monday 22 June 2020
- SP1 commencement to be confirmed
- SP7 commencement to be confirmed

Please read the [protocol for the use of Seek Scan Thermal Imaging](/downloads/protocol-for-the-use-of-seek-scan-thermal-imaging.pdf).

**You are required to print, sign and return [this letter](/downloads/introduction-to-temperature-checking-in-the-workplace.pdf) to HR. This letter becomes part of your contract of employment.**

Once again thank you for your continued support during this time and if you have any questions then please do not hesitate to ask.

Regards,

**Debbie Keeley**<br>
Head of HR at QPHL
