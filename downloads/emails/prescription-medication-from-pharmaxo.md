Dear team,

Hope you are all well.

At the moment many pharmacies are currently still open and repeat prescriptions should be available as usual. It’s important for us all to understand that there are no medicines shortages as a result of COVID-19 as many supermarkets and pharmacies have been stockpiling in preparation for Brexit.

Just like with groceries, individuals are being urged not to stockpile drugs for themselves. If everyone tries to get more medication than they currently need, it will put strain on the system.  

However, people with health conditions who require medication should ensure they have enough to see them through an isolation period (currently one to two weeks).

What we would like to offer you is if you or a family member are on regular medication Pharmaxo can hold a small supply for you and your loved ones. All we would need from you is:

- A photo of your medication/screenshot of your repeat medication list  
- Be able to request/collect a paper copy of your prescription from your surgery or arrange for this to be posted – you should be able to get this by giving them a call

Please note that practices are being encouraged to put as many suitable patients on to electronic repeat dispensing as soon as they can. This will speed up the process for repeat prescriptions to be authorised but currently Pharmaxo cannot operate this service.

Any questions or to take advantage of this service please email [dispensary@pharmaxo.com](mailto:dispensary@pharmaxo.com).

Best regards,
