Dear team,

Attached is a [PDF](/downloads/covid-secure-workplace-risk-assessment-v8.pdf) for you to be able to see the outcome of our COVID-19 Safe Workplace Risk Assessment. We are sharing the details on the [qphl.co/coronavirus](https://qphl.co/coronavirus/) public page so your families might see the work we have done, should they be interested or concerned.

It has taken a little longer to complete it as comprehensively as we felt it should be, there are around 20 pages of risk assessed and/or actions taken. The risk assessment has been no small task for the team to deliver, thank you to all who were involved. Specific thanks to Stuart Kotchie and Martyn Smith, who I can see from activity records have been working well outside normal hours to give this job the level of attention “Our community” deserves.

Most of the actions required to make us safe had already been thought of and implemented; this is a testament to the work we have all done within “Our community”, well done. In many areas, we exceed the guidelines, these additional measures will, of course, remain in place. There are some areas where we can make incremental improvements, such as marking out more flow lanes, and there are other areas where will add even further levels of protection.

One such area will be the introduction of thermal scanning of all visitors, contractors and members of “Our community” at site entrances for elevated temperatures. We are delighted to be installing the very first one in Europe from Thermal Seek, and you can view the system we are testing [in this video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/400078835).

We have received the first delivery of masks for you and your households to use outside of work. They are packed in 3s; there should be enough for all to take one pack home, these are being distributed through your line managers this week. We have child sizes on their way; HR are working out how many are required. Please remember they are not disposable, the technical sheet for them that includes washing instructions will be on our COVID-19 webpage.

Many will be aware that Bath ASU has been subject to an MHRA audit that concludes today. Amongst all this, it is easy to have perhaps forgotten that Bath ASU has had work to do to improve regulatory compliance. Rather than the usual single inspector on-site for three days, the MHRA have put our team through a 13-day virtual inspection. As if the new virtual model wasn’t hard enough to deal with the length of time under such scrutiny will have been demanding, thanks to all directly involved for your efforts – Rob and Tara report that you have maintained your professionalism throughout. The inspection was positioned as a placeholder by the MHRA, so there will be no change in risk status without a subsequent site visit. However, there are clear signs in feedback from the inspectors, and the issues raised for us to work on, that our progression has been noted.

Lastly, an appeal. As we get more liberties and the NHS rolls out contact tracing both manually and eventually through the smartphone app, we must become even more alert to the risks associated with unnecessary contacts. Whilst infection rates in the South West are the lowest in the country; it won’t necessarily stay that way as the virus transmission rates increase following more contact. The basic disciplines still apply, if the park is crowded then come back later, we all need to wash hands frequently, etc.

We have got this far by working together to keep “Our community” safe. As [our new social media video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRSKBNemmNY) shows, we are indeed all in this together.

There is still a long way to go, through following social distancing measures, we are looking out for each other even when apart. That’s not just the actions of a workplace; that’s us working together as a family.
