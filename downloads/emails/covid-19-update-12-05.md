You may have listened to, and probably heard reported, the Prime Minister’s briefing on Sunday. It set out the path to normality at a strategic level and stressed the importance of remaining vigilant and diligent in exercising appropriate controls and restraint.

The executive team did meet on Sunday evening for our initial review of the plans. However, the detail on specific measures and processes is only just becoming apparent. Martyn Smith and Stuart Kotchie are working through the multiple levels of recommendations as I write this note. These will be reviewed by the executive team and approved at board level within the next couple of days; we will share the detail with you in the same way as we have done up until now. We may have further risk assessments to complete around specific activities over the following days.

As of today we have no one on sick leave. This is both a measure of how successful you have been in adhering to our control measures in Corsham, and following the stay at home guidance outside of work.  

However, I am sure you will all have noticed more people and traffic around this week. This was to be expected, but with increased movement there comes more contact and risk. Whilst we are reviewing company practice, we are identifying areas where our behaviour may have begun to slip a little – we will address those as soon as possible. We should all also do the same personally, just to reassure ourselves that we are keeping our homes as safe as we can too.
