Dear team,

We have seen significant reductions in COVID-19 cases in our local areas and across the UK in 2021 as a combined result of the lockdown measures and the vaccination of millions of people.

Over the past year we have introduced a range of COVID-19 risk mitigation measures to keep our business and community safe and the COVID-19 Exec group have been undertaking a review of these measures that reduce COVID-19 cases. As restrictions ease there is still the potential for case rates to increase so it is sensible to be cautious over which measures are removed and when during the restriction easing period.

Our priority is to ensure we effectively manage risk, ensure the business can be as productive as possible and have a fully vaccinated community to protect each other, our families, and patients. Some of our measures have proven to be such a success and have no impact on our productivity that we do not plan to alter for the considerable future, such as the provision of hand sanitisation and disinfectant to clean work areas.

The thermal imaging cameras in the receptions have now been superseded by our COVID-19 surveillance testing as the testing can identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic staff, visitors, and contractors. As such the cameras will be removed from the reception spaces from the beginning of May.

We will be confirming which other restrictions are being discontinued prior to their removal in due course.
