Good Afternoon All,

With the ongoing changes that are being enforced with regards to travel and returning to the UK by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) it is imperative that all employees keep themselves up to date if you have any intention of travelling aboard or to other areas of the UK. We are all very aware that the pandemic has not gone away and we must not become complacent about the consequences of one of our employees putting themselves at risk and then coming to work unknowingly as COVID-19 positive. I have attached the pandemic policy for information, but can I ask you to refresh yourselves with this policy especially section 2.5.

If you want to keep up to date on the changes regarding travel you can sign up for alerts by going to [https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) going to the bottom of the page and clicking on ‘email’ under ‘Get updates for all countries’, this will then take you to create subscription where you can subscribe.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you keep yourselves up to date with all company policies and these are accessible either via the intranet, on People HR and by going to `S:\Admin\Public\Employee Policies`.  If at any point you are not clear on any factors within these policies then you must ensure that you seek clarification from HR.

Regards,

**Debbie Keeley**<br>
Head of HR
