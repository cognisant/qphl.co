Hi Everyone

During these uncertain times it is becoming apparent that some companies are unable to keep their staff employed and are unable to pay them for several months reducing many household incomes.

We may have some available positions where we can offer some paid temporary work to those in this situation. Some of the positions that we would be looking to fill are as follows, therefore we are looking for skills in;

- IT Infrastructure – helpdesk
- Drivers
- Stores/warehouse
- Call Centre/Patient Services
- Nurses (non-NHS)
- Pharmacy roles (non-NHS secondary care)
- Childcare/teachers

If you do have anyone within your family/household who could offer any help with the above or have any skills/talents to offer, then please either [Click here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAPya-E1UNlNROTBUV1QwV0EwUDRRTTVLQkRLQzhJVi4u) or complete [this form](/downloads/potential-work-for-family-members-form.docx) and return to hr ([hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co)).

If they do then become a temporary employee, then they themselves will be classed as a key worker whereby children will be able to continue to attend school/nursery.

If you have any questions, then please do not hesitate to ask myself or one of my team.

Your sincerely
