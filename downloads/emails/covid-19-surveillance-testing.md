Dear team,

Following our surveillance testing programme's success with members of the QPHL shared departments and field nursing team, as part of Our commitment to you, we will be extending surveillance testing across the QPHL group.

Throughout the pandemic, we have led the way within our industries with our COVID-19 mitigation plans so, therefore, starting on Thursday 21 January QPHL will commence COVID-19 surveillance testing of all staff. This is to ensure we minimise the potential of transmission within the workplace and keep our community safe.

Staff who have an established work pattern in a QPHL building will be tested on a pre-arranged, twice-weekly appointment basis and details will be provided to you by your line manager.

Those staff whose attendance in a QPHL building is on an ad-hoc basis will be required to pre-book a test with HR before coming to the site and entering a building.

We will maintain surveillance testing until the recent surge in cases following Christmas and the rise of the new variant of COVID-19 has reduced in our local areas. Informing a decision over monitoring will be determined by the GOV.UK coronavirus 7-day case rates. We will revisit the surveillance testing when we see a sustained reduction in levels to be below 100 per 100,000 population in key local geographic areas, such as Corsham, Chippenham, Bath, North Somerset. Case data will also be considered concerning both Bristol and Swindon.
