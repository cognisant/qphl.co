Dear team,

It somehow felt inevitable that Lockdown 3 the sequel was due for imminent release. Like all sequels the plot follows a familiar pattern. Increasing infection rates, health service under strain, personal tragedy, heroes (scientist and healthcare workers) and villains (5G, Trump, deniers) thrown in too. We also have plot twists. Just as vaccines are within reach, new virus strains emerge.

I sincerely hope that this goes the way of all good trilogies (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc.) and stays just that way, just three, no more, the End.

## During this lockdown we have important work to do.

The NHS is going to come under extraordinary pressure over the next 3 months. Whilst clinical teams are much better equipped and more knowledgeable than this time last year, there are already more people in hospital with COVID-19 than ever before. This is surely set to rise further. Vaccines need administering to millions of people. There remain thousands of patients who need treating for cancer and chronic disease that rely on our services.

We must maintain these services whilst internal NHS resources are dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients and vaccinating the vulnerable.

## There are differences between now and last March

There are four key things:

### Childcare and schools

Whilst schools have been closed to all but key workers, childcare and early years settings remain open including nurseries, childminders and nannies. Unregistered childcare bubbles with family and neighbours are also allowed. Our children can still attend school as children of key healthcare workers. A refreshed letter is on its way for you to present to your schools.

### New virus strain

The new strain of the virus is more transmittable; it appears to increase the R rate by between 0.4-0.7. Put simply, that means it spreads more easily, it can infect you more easily, you can infect someone else more easily. We are all likely to have subconsciously allowed our social distancing disciplines to have slipped recently. Now is the time to revisit them at home and at work.

Remember, it works:  Hands - Face - Space

### Vaccines

There are now vaccines that work. Thanks in no small part to the work of UK scientists and regulators. They will take time to roll out, we will be vaccinated in time and some of us will be in the priority groups. This should give us all hope of protection and a return to normality.

### We know what to do

We have been here before; we have been good at it. The work we have done to keep each other safe in our workplace is impressive, zero in work transmission. Your disciplines outside of work seem strong. We have recently carried out over 650 Christmas bubble and return to work tests seeing only a single field worker test positive. We should not be complacent, but we can be confident we are capable.

The government announcement last night clearly indicates the NHS is aiming give the first vaccine dose to priority groups by the 2nd half of February. This achieves initial protection for the vulnerable by the 2nd half of March. This is the trigger point for restrictions to begin being lifted, Easter is therefore the horizon.

Our aim should be to ensure the NHS can deliver that. Our role is to maintain our capacity, deliver our products and services to treat cancer and chronic patients. Allowing the NHS to focus on this final effort to overcome threat from the Coronavirus pandemic.

Whilst we might not have had reasons to party our way out of 2020, let's do our best to make 2021 a happier new year.
