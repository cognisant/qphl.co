Dear team,

Following a “Can it be better?” suggestion, we’ve decided to make some changes to our COVID-19 updates sent to you each day by SMS.

## What we do currently

At the moment, every day you receive a text message outlining the number of employees self-isolating, the number of tests taken over a rolling 7-day period and how many of these tests are positive, negative or awaiting result.

## What’s changing?

From **Monday 21st June and every Monday thereafter**, we will be changing the frequency of our COVID-19 updates from daily to weekly. In addition, now that we are able to offer onsite vaccinations thanks to Pharmaxo’s efforts, we are going to change what we report. The format will be as follows:

- Number of tests taken
- How many of these tests are positive
- Percentage of employees fully vaccinated
- Percentage of employees partially vaccinated
- Number of employees vaccinated by Pharmaxo

You will notice that, where before the focus was on the number of tests taken and test results, now we will be shifting our focus to vaccination numbers.

We will still report on testing, however we will only be providing data for the number of tests taken and any positive results. In the event of a positive test, you will still receive a separate text alert.

Our vaccine updates will include the terminology “partially vaccinated” and “fully vaccinated.” Whilst some vaccines are single dose, and so only one vaccine is required for them to be considered fully vaccinated, others require 2 doses for maximum effectiveness.

The second dose of a 2-part vaccine is typically carried out within 12 weeks of the first. Therefore, when we talk about partially vaccinated, we are referring to those who have had their first vaccine but are awaiting their second. Partially vaccinated individuals will exhibit some immunity, but not maximum. Those who are fully vaccinated have had either both doses of a 2-part vaccine or a single dose vaccine.

Finally, our figures on the number of employees vaccinated by Pharmaxo will give you an indication as to how many members of our community and wider community have been protected by our ability to offer vaccines on-site. After many months of uncertainty, this will be an uplifting message and we should all be proud of this contribution to the fight against COVID-19.

**If you have any questions regarding the new format of our COVID-19 updates, please contact HR.**
