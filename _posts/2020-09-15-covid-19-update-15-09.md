Dear team,

As our children return to their schools and the Autumn is upon us, we have also moved our COVID-19 preparations to a new level; preparations for potential COVID-19 clusters and outbreaks within our Community here at QPHL.

Whilst not yet followed by increased hospital admission, increasing COVID-19 positive tests in the general population are leading to local lockdowns. We have seen small outbreaks locally in Swindon and Wiltshire with Wiltshire Council Public Health and PHE acting swiftly to bring them under control. Nobody should believe the worst is past us, the science still backs the Government in this clear and simple message; “Stick to the guidance”:

<img src="/images/hands-face-space.png" alt="Hands: wash your hands regularly. Face: Wear a face covering in indoor settings where social distancing may be difficult, and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. Space: Stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings or increasing ventilation indoors).">

Last week we invited Wiltshire CC, PHE and the NHS onsite to review our COVID-19 planning and actions. The purpose of the visit was twofold: 1, to allow us to introduce our site, what we do and its importance to the national healthcare supply chain, 2, to assess our preparation and provide guidance on our work to ensure a COVID-19 safe workplace and future cluster and outbreak control.

The visit provided very good feedback. What we already do as normal are measures they recommend for businesses in the middle of dealing with a cluster or outbreak. Wiltshire Public Health Team have subsequently asked if we would share our materials and approaches with other businesses which we will of course willingly do, the safer they are the safer we are. Whilst this accolade should not make us complacent, it is comforting to know experts consider us to be well prepared. Our COVID-19 leadership group can take pride in this.

As mentioned earlier, we have set out [how we will manage a COVID cluster or outbreak](/downloads/qphl-covid-19-outbreak-response.pdf).

Communication is important. Open and transparent communication will keep us all safe and confident that our teams are managing clusters and outbreaks effectively to minimize risk. So, we will be sharing with you all summary and detailed information about the current testing and COVID-19 status within our Community at QPHL. You will receive two types of text message direct to your personal mobile that you have logged with HR:

1. Between 10:00-10:15 Monday to Friday – a message setting out the current status about how many team members are self-isolating, how many tests have been carried out, +/- results, etc. These will start tomorrow, Wednesday 16th September.
1. When a member of one of our teams has a positive test, you will be told by a separate text message. This will include their name, company, team, etc. HR will have already contact traced anyone within QPHL who might have been in unusually close contact with the team member.

We are doing this to ensure everyone has clear access to objective facts. Inaccurate rumors, and sometimes scaremongering, have been unhelpful features of clusters and outbreaks elsewhere in Wiltshire. We think openness and transparency are tools to use against this, if one of our team members tests positive, or maybe I should say when, you will hear about it from us.

Make good decisions, stay safe.
