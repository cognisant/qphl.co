Good morning, all.

As some of you may be aware Pharmaxo have been accepted as a COVID-19 Vaccination Centre, so that this can happen we are having to re-purpose the A14/A15 Portacabins where the bi-weekly COVID-19 surveillance testing takes place.

With effect from Thursday 3rd June 2021 surveillance testing will now take place in the SP3 (Bath ASU) reception area (next to the stairs), these will continue to be on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday between 11:00 to 13:00 and 13:30 to 15:00.

Your appointment days and times will remain the same, so please ensure that you continue to attend for your tests.

Many thanks,

**Debbie Keeley**<br>
