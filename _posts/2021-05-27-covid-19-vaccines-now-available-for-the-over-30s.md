Good morning everyone,

The Government has today announced that appointments for the COVID-19 vaccinations have been made available to everyone over the age of 30 or will be 30 prior to 1st July 2021. If you have not yet had your vaccine and do not wish to wait to be called by your GP practice then you can book an appointment using the following link;

In order to book you will need to have your NHS number to hand. This can be found on any letter you have received from a hospital but if you do not know your NHS number you can find it at the following website.

Once you have received your first and your second vaccine, please send a photo of your vaccination card (with your name on) to [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).

Finally, don’t forget to spread the word to your family and friends so that we can all do our part to protect our community.

Best Wishes,
