Dear all,

A high temperature is one of the key symptoms of COVID-19, which is why we have installed thermal scanners to be used when first entering the buildings. To protect you, our team, your families and our patients, it is essential that, should the scanners detect a high temperature, you follow our policy. So we are all aware what to do should this happen, we have made a video which shows how the scanners will notify you should your temperature be elevated, and what the correct procedure is; [please click here to view or visit the intranet](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/e4c39bb3-6008-4e61-a3c5-0de85317ed44).
