Dear team,

Thank you for submitting your COVID-19 questions to Chris Watt. You can view the video of his responses by [clicking here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/2e05cd4a-e98e-4b96-ae87-8b81b7cb18f4). There were some similar questions so we have merged those together. They were mostly about homeworking, social distancing, and self-isolation. The questions are below and answers are in the video.

1. What are we doing about home-working, when the governments advice is everyone who can should be?
2. During Level 5, am I being redeployed, & if I am at the time home-working, how does that work?
3. If I think I have skills in other areas, will I be redeployed there?
4. If someone in our team or the same building contracts COVID-19, does the whole team or building have to self-isolate?
5. Should we be using masks in non-classified areas?
6. Are Microgenetics able to help with any of the testing kits or development?
7. Will Pharmaxo have access to the new testing kits being released?
8. Are we in danger of losing our jobs?

Whilst I’m emailing you all I would also like to touch on isolating at home and the importance of obtaining your information on COVID-19 from trusted sources.

The guidance on stay at home / self-isolation is quite clear for your average household. There are edge cases though where the guidance is not so clear. Examples might be households where children are in shared custody, people who are returning from foreign trips, a foster parent may take an emergency placement of an abused or neglected child. These edge cases require a sensible and pragmatic assessment of the guidance we have.

It is HR’s role to help make those assessments with you. The HR team are supported in this by our own highly qualified and experienced clinical team here in Pharmaxo, we have over 200 years collective clinical experience in our team. Our aim is to ensure we follow guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19 in “Our community” whilst maximising attendance, maximising patients treated and in doing so relieving pressure on NHS resources. HR have already dealt  with a number of these assessments and our clinical team has supported hundreds of patients at home in interpreting guidance and understanding how to change our behaviours to minimise risk.

Access to healthcare professionals and being supported well by HR will help us, use them to discuss interpretations and any anxieties you might have. The team are here for you always but especially in these unprecedented times.

We have created a webpage for you to find all the [trusted information on COVID-19](https://qphl.co/coronavirus). There are a lot of myths and incorrect information being shared on social media at the moment which are adding to everyone’s anxiety at this time. Always check the source of information that is being shared with you. If the information you are reading is not sources from Public Health England, the UK Government, The World Health Organisation (WHO) or the NHS, this is not a trusted piece of information.

Best wishes,

**Alison Davis**<br>
Managing Director, Pharmaxo
