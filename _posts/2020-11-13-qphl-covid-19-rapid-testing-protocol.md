As many of you will be aware, QPHL have purchased a supply of Roche COVID-19 Rapid test kits to help protect the business and our community. We have recently been working through how we will utilise and deploy these tests to minimise risk at work.

Please read the [attached protocol](/downloads/qphl-covid-19-testing-strategy.docx) that explains how we will be utilising testing. This testing protocol is relevant to all staff, and the limited visitors and contractors allowed on site for critical business requirements only. We have already begun our monitoring testing staff who travel between the different business buildings and we will implement the visitor and contractor testing protocols from Monday 23rd November.

As a reminder, all staff with additional jobs outside of QPHL need to inform HR of their other roles, please email HR with details.
