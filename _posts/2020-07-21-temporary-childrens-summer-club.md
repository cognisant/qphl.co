Good morning, Everyone,

As some of you will be aware, since the COVID-19 outbreak and as part of Our commitment to you we have been supporting employees experiencing challenges with child care due to the closure of schools and nurseries, as well as grandparents needing to self-isolate for their protection with onsite childcare over the past few months which will finish on Friday 24th July.

Despite the reopening of some facilities we are aware there has been some reduction in available childcare over the summer period which is usually provided in the form of holiday clubs and have worked hard over recent weeks to determine if we could provide some additional support for those struggling.

We have successfully managed to organise a temporary children’s summer club at a new location from Monday 27th July to Friday 28th August and this will be located at Neston Memorial Hall (5 mins away from Corsham Science Park) from 08:15 to 17:15 Monday to Friday. The child carers that are currently in SP7 will be moving across along with a couple of new ones so that we can accommodate more children. This facility offers more space both inside and out and will maintain your children in a safe environment.

This summer club facility is open to all employees across the group of companies who are struggling to source child care over the summer holidays due to the reduction in holiday club availability around our local area.

If you would like to take advantage of the summer club then there would be a cost of £20.00 per child per day or part there of (payment for attendance will be taken from your net salary at the end of August and September), you will also be required to complete the attached form so that your child/children can be allocated a place and our child carers are aware of when they are to be expected at the summer club. Please print, complete and sign the attached form and return this back to [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co) as soon as possible.

We hope you agree that this confirms our continuing support through our value ‘Our commitment to you’ during a time when everybody is finding challenges within everyday life.

If you do have any questions then please do email [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).

Best Wishes,

**Debbie Keeley**<br>
Head of HR
