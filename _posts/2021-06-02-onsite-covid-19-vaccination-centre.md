Pharmaxo is delighted to be joining the fight against COVID-19 by opening a COVID vaccination site from Thursday 3rd June. Not only does this represent our commitment to our community, but also to you all by being in a position to offer onsite vaccinations for many of you.

For those of you who are eligible for vaccination based on the current cohorts permitted you can book your vaccination via the [online booking portal](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/).

Some of you are not yet eligible; but in order to ensure every dose we have onsite can be fully utilised, it is possible that in the event people who are booked do not arrive, we can offer these vaccinations to you on a standby basis.

If you would like to be included on our standby list, can you please [complete this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=R77BsNirjESm4LHvZaFurpjMYd7H5zlIpFE_HJoEApxUMTVYQTFBRkJIT0k5RTJCRjlDUUVaSkVNTi4u). In the event that we have vaccine that must be used, we will contact you directly to ensure you can be on site within the required timeframe.

## We are also asking for your help!

In order to hit the vaccine numbers that we have pledged to achieve, we will need volunteers to help our team of nurses and pharmacists with the following:

- Parking/welcoming stewards (to receive patients to their appointments and book them in on an iPad)
- Observation staff (to observe patients for signs of anaphylaxis for 15 minutes after their jab)
- Vaccine preparers (to dilute and draw up vaccine ready for administration)
- Administrative staff (to carry out weekly stock counts, run reports and manage the bookings calendar etc.)

Going forwards, we need volunteers weekly on the following days and times:

- Thursdays 9-11am and 3-8pm
- Fridays 8-11am and 4-8pm
- Saturdays 8am-6pm (in 2-3-hour shifts)

If you and/or any of your friends or family members are free during these times and would like to commit to a shift weekly (or sporadically) then please respond to this email with your availability.

Volunteers do not have to be healthcare professionals, and will be trained appropriately before getting stuck in. Any questions, please reach out.

If you are able to give up some of your time to support our community please [complete this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=R77BsNirjESm4LHvZaFurpjMYd7H5zlIpFE_HJoEApxUM1BCTFMyMjZUODk2VVpEWDBPWk4zMks5QS4u).

In order to facilitate the vaccination centre there will be no parking available to staff in the A14/15 parking spaces to the front or rear of the building. Staff should park in the lower car park of Corsham Science Park; please ensure that your car is registered with HR if you have not previously done so.

Smoking will no longer be permitted in the A14/15 compound. The designated smoking area will be relocated to a designed area at the rear of A14/15.

Thank you.
