Dear team,

From next week, children that are in secondary school will need to begin wearing masks whilst attending school.

In response to this, and part of Our commitment to you, there will shortly be boxes of face masks at each building reception.

If you have children that are attending secondary school, please feel free to collect a box of 50 masks on your way home.
