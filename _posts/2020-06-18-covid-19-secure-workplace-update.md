Dear team,

As a follow up from the [COVID Secure Workplace Risk Assessment](/downloads/covid-secure-workplace-risk-assessment-v8.pdf), we have identified additional controls that will be implemented across the group to continue to ensure employee safety during the pandemic. Please read the below in detail as these additional controls and measures will be effective immediately.

## Entrances to SP3 & SP1

Only one person is to enter the revolving doors in SP3 at a time, or enter into SP1 reception space until the barriers are clear and no one is exiting. This will help provide separation/space between people. Signage will be implemented shortly.

## Uniforms

For those that have been issued a uniform, please ensure that you wear a freshly laundered polo shirt daily. You should have been issued enough items for this to be achievable; please contact [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co) if that is not the case.

## Meetings

Where possible, all meetings should be conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams to limit face to face interaction. If this is not possible, you must stay 2m apart and limit the number of people in attendance.

## Your workspace

In your work areas cleaning spray has been made available to you, please ensure you are cleaning your equipment after every use. This includes your desk, keyboard and mouse.

## All rules still apply

At the start of the pandemic, we became very diligent at proper handwashing technique, not touching your face and sneezing/coughing into elbows or tissue and disposing of it. These rules are all still as essential and must be followed by all. Please remind your colleagues of this.

## Personal mail

To limit the number of items coming in and out of the building, for the period of COVID-19, you are not allowed to have personal items delivered to site.

## Showers

The showers can still be used, but no items (such as towels) are to be left in them. Any items that are left behind will be disposed of.

## Car share vs public transport

Currently, car sharing is a safer option than public transport. For those that can car share, we ask that any passengers sit in the back seat to maximise distance from the driver.

We understand that this is more rules to follow and want to thank you for your diligence so far. The lack of COVID-19 in our workplace is a testament to all the work we have done. We now need to implement these additional rules to continue to ensure the safety of all employees and of course, the people they come into contact with.

Thank you for your continued dedication.
