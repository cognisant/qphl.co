Firstly, sorry I didn’t get this sent before the weekend.

We are all doing our best to follow the developing situation in relation to COVID-19; lockdown easing, masks, testing, etc. We are learning that different countries have approached things in different ways, e.g. Sweden has no formal lockdown, and we are encouraged to think by the media this is bad or reckless. I disagree, there is only one guarantee right now and that is that no one can precisely tell us what works and what doesn’t. This is new, we are all learning from the evidence as it unfolds.

There is certainty around some things, shielding vulnerable people works and injecting disinfectant doesn’t (yes Trump really suggested that!). There is speculation about others, what can a mask do and how many of us have had COVID-19 with no symptoms.

Of course, that uncertainty brings fear and anxiety. It undermines basic needs that we had naturally begun taking for granted: clean air, food on the table, etc. Abraham Maslow was a 20th century psychologist; he developed the now famous [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). His theory sets out that unless Physiological (health, food, shelter) and Safety (security, money, NHS) needs are met, we can never move on to fulfilling higher needs and desires around social belonging, self-esteems, etc.

COVID-19 has blown apart our assumptions about those basic needs. We ask ourselves daily if the air is safe to breath, has this food product been contaminated, is my partner’s job secure, can I get treated for cancer and about many other deeply troubling concerns.

Whilst we don’t have all the answers, at QPHL we are trying to address some of these basic needs with the actions we have taken. Some of them are listed below, send me ideas if you think we can do more to support our community with this.

Don’t forget we are also maintaining a mobile friendly [public facing website](https://qphl.co/coronavirus) that helps us find trusted sources of information about the coronavirus and COVID-19.

We should also celebrate what we do well and what we are looking forward to.

Microgentics has begun SwiftDetect field trials on testing Septoria in wheat crops and will progress our bovine (cows) tuberculosis testing soon. Bath ASU goes live with the SmartControl environmental monitoring system within days. They are looking forward to getting their building back (no offence kids) and meeting new team members who have only ever worked from home.

Pharmaxo is treating over 2,000 patients extra at home who would otherwise have had their treatments delayed or cancelled. That’s 2,000 more families able to face this crisis in better shape than otherwise. Pharmaxo is now Bath ASU’s biggest customer, what a milestone! The Pharmaxo team are looking forward to celebrating birthdays and weddings properly again, together.

Bath ASU’s back log is all but cleared, a responsive service to NHS restored and in good time to help deal with the NHS’s changing needs. Exciting improvement projects being delivered (paperless balances) and more planned (vial vacuum project) making progress. The team looking forward to Summer sun on their faces at lunchtimes.

We have a lot to look forward to together. One small thing is that we’ll ensure we have some picnic chairs for people to use the grassed areas on great summer days. When this thing is over we’ll come together to celebrate that (party style) and reflect on our achievements in how we faced it.

In Captain Tom’s words, “You have to remember we will get through it in the end, it will be alright.”

Have a great weekend, see you Monday.
