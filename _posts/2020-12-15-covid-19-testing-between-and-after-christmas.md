Dear teams,

As you are all aware, [we have offered](/coronavirus/updates/pre-christmas-employee-and-bubble-testing/) you and your families COVID-19 tests before you go into your bubbles this Christmas. This is to protect you, your families and of course our wider community.

To continue this, when you return to Corsham Science park 28th–31st December AND from the 4th–8th January you will be tested before you’re allowed back onto site.

So if you are working in between Christmas and New Year you will be required to have TWO TESTS, once in between Christmas and the New Year and once after.

The purpose of this is to protect “Our community” when you return after your Christmas break, we can then be confident that we are keeping our colleagues and of course our patients safe. Emails will be going out later this week to give you your testing slot when you return to work after your Christmas break. If you have any questions at all please email [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).
