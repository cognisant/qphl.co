Dear employees,

As we heard yesterday, schools intend to shut from Friday, and we understand that this will put pressure on a lot of you.

As we are a critical healthcare provider and therefore you are key workers, schools and nurseries should still be taking your children. Attached is a letter from Chris Watt and a template for you to fill in so you can reach out to your schools/nurseries.

For those parents that will still struggle for childcare, as part of “Our commitment to you”, we will be providing free childcare on site in Unit 7 Corsham Science Park (the new Microgenetics offices) from Monday 24th March.

Attached is more information and a form we would need you to fill in Can you please complete this and send back to [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co) as soon as possible.

Thank you for your continued commitment.

**Debbie Keeley**<br>
Head of HR
