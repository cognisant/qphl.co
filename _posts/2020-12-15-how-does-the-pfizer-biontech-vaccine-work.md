title: How does the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine work?
category: Vaccine information

The new vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca are gene-based vaccines, which means instead of using part of a virus or an inactivated virus they use part of the instructions to make certain virus proteins.

For these vaccines, the instructions used are in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA) for making the coronavirus spike protein. The mRNA instructions are delivered to our cells in different ways. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine transports the mRNA in a less harmful virus—a common cold-causing adenovirus—that is engineered so it can’t replicate in the host. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines wrap the mRNA in oily bubbles made of lipid nanoparticles.
