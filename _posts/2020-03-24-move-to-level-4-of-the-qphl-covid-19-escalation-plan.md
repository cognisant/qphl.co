All

With the rate at which guidance is changing, I am sure you, like me, are finding it increasingly difficult to assimilate it all and act accordingly. I will set out some of it below in a bid to make it clearer.

The Prime Minister made clear last night what the Government expects of us. We are key workers, made official in the Government's announcement last week, and as I have written before we are part of the response to this. Whilst we are not on the COVID-19 front line in hospitals, it is our job to ensure that the NHS can focus on that by remaining a place “Where patients come first” in Corsham and wherever our nursing team is, in our patients’ homes.

**We are moving to level 4 of our escalation plan.**

Many of our planned level 4 actions are in alignment with current government guidance on working practices and social distancing, it therefore seems prudent to move to level 4. There are some changes to level 4 actions which are highlighted in the updated posters.

We all fit into one of three categories; these categories are described in more detail in the guidance and posters in our cafes:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Brief Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Extremely vulnerable</td>
            <td>People with a relevant condition that significantly weakens their immune system such that they will find it very difficult to fight off a COVID-19 infection. These people will have received a letter from the NHS.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Social Distancing</td>
            <td>THIS IS EVERYONE! and is simple – IF NOT AT WORK STAY AT HOME.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stay at home (self-isolating)</td>
            <td>If you or a household member has or has recently had symptoms.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

There is important work to do this week to ensure our “extremely vulnerable” team members are working from home or redeployed to roles that can be done from home. We will also be prioritising employees who are at an ‘increased risk of severe illness’ according to previous Gov guidance on social distancing to work from home in their current roles if they can be done fully and effectively.

**Employment policy – Priority to familial household members for employment in vacant QPHL roles.**

We have a number of permanent vacancies that are open. We are also creating a number of temporary roles to help us get through the crisis. We anticipate that even with the Government commitment to support companies retaining workers that there will still be significant layoffs, this will affect Our community as partners lose work. With immediate effect, all positions open, permanent or temporary, will be prioritised for members of families within households of our teams’ members where they have been laid off as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. There will be some exclusions, and we will need to retain flexibility but where we can the company will maintain “Our commitment to you” in delivering this.

As well as our role here at work and the changes we are making to maintain our ability to support the NHS, we are now also enduring changes to our way of life that will be with us for some time. Without being complacent, I am taking comfort from the detail behind the apocalyptic headlines. There are scientists all over the world collaborating in new ways in the race to develop a vaccine to protect us against this Coronavirus. Scientists and medics are running around 400 clinical trials testing drugs may work against the COVID-19 disease that you get from the infection.

Whilst we look after “Our community”, and the NHS looks after us, these scientist and medics are looking for and will find the light at the end of the tunnel.
