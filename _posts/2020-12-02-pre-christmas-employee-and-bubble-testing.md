Dear teams,

As I’m sure you are aware, QPHL has purchased a supply of Roche COVID-19 Rapid test kits.  Part of your Christmas plans, may include celebrating the festive season with people from two other households.

As part of our value ‘Our commitment to you’ and our dedication to supporting our QPHL community, we would like to offer you and members of your bubbles a Pre-Christmas COVID-19 test to give you all peace of mind.

Further details will be emailed nearer the time but for now can you please complete [this questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=R77BsNirjESm4LHvZaFuruQo8dorEflGmIVFuETxR15UN09SRVlJTkZPQjRQR1pCRkpLOTNFTTVFQy4u) by the 9th December 2020.

If you have any further questions then please direct these to [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).
