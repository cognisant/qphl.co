Dear team,

We would like to pass on our thanks to all members of staff that have made our internal testing system over the Christmas holidays a success, and everyoneâ€™s willingness to participate in testing, in order to keep our community safe. The results speak for themselves; we reported no on-site positive tests, which is a testament to how our community are following COVID-19 restrictions.

## COVID-19 procedure reminder

As a reminder to all staff, whether you are working from home, on-site, field-based or on annual leave you must alert HR as soon as you have symptoms of COVID-19, not after you have a test. This is so we can take you through our internal COVID-19 procedure.

## COVID-19 tests are available

We have tests available for you and your support bubble/household members for your piece of mind and safety.

## Contact details for reporting symptoms or booking a test

If you have symptoms or you or someone in your support bubble/household would like a test, please contact the HR team either by calling the HR mobile on 07947&nbsp;487111 or email [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).

## COVID-19 routine testing

We should all be aware that that local infection rates in the West Country are rising as well as the rest of the country. In response the this, our COVID-19 outbreak team are working out how we can continue routinely testing all team members. More information will be sent out this week regarding when and how this will begin.

If you have any questions at all, please send an email to [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).
