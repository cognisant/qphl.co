Dear team,

As part of our continued work to make sure that QPHL is a COVID-19 secure workplace, we are working through our in-depth risk assessment to implement some actions that we will be communicating to you over the next few weeks.

The first of which will be effective from tomorrow morning. The only entrance and exit to be used to access the SP3 building will be the revolving doors to our reception area. All other doors including the A15 access, A15 yard access and SP3 reception doors will become fire routes only, and will only be accessible in the event of the fire alarms sounding. Passes will be disabled to prevent entry and exit from these doors, however they will still open in the event of a fire. Can we please ask that only one person enters the revolving doors at one time and you adhere to the social distancing guidelines we have already communicated to you.

For those that need access to the A15 yard the warehouse and facilities teams will be making high visibility jackets available to you for your safety.  Please adhere to the designated pedestrian walkways through the A15 yard, crossing the vehicle routes safely as this primarily used by is a heavy goods and delivery vehicles. Please note, no phones are to be used when walking through the A15 yard.

For those managers who have teams with limited email access, can you please communicate to your team members so they are aware of these changes.

Further instructions will follow on new social distancing rules and thermal scanner (temperature checking station) usage.

Best regards,
