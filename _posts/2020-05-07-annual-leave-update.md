Dear team,

In my email on 17th March, we made some temporary changes to the booking of annual leave. We allowed for the cancellation of annual leave. We also implemented a minimum of two months’ notice in the short term so that we could ensure we had maximum capacity, as at that time we were unaware of how COVID-19 would affect us as a Community.

I’m pleased to share that we have not experienced significant shortages of resource in the business and most of our redeployment and retraining plans are complete. In the last 6 weeks, over 180 of our colleagues have been through some form of learning and/or training experience, enabling them to be redeployed or work from home. This is equipping us to face any short-term capacity or capability challenges better. Thank you all for the extra efforts made in making this happen. It is impressive evidence of commitment to our value “Is there more to learn?”.

## What is changing?

With immediate effect, we are now going to reverse the change to our annual leave policy. You can now book your annual leave as before with no restrictions - other than the usual departmental restrictions regarding the number of people permitted leave at the same time in each department. We also require you to book annual leave, see below.

## What do you need to do?

You will need to book and take a minimum of two weeks (10 days) annual leave before the end of October. This needs to be agreed with your line manager by the 5th June, using the normal application process. However, we strongly recommend you make a leave application before the 22nd May so that any conflicts might be resolved amicably. If you do not submit any leave requests, you will be allocated 10 days to take as leave, most likely as five long weekends.

We understand that you may not be able to travel to your planned holiday destination. Still, with the pressures and consequences of lockdown, it is important that you all take some time away from work to maintain your wellbeing. Also, we have an obligation as your employer to ensure that you take your annual leave.

For April, when the company restricted the booking of annual leave due to COVID-19, i.e. when you could not take leave, you will have accrued circa two days annual leave. These can either be used this year as normal or carried over to the next two holiday years as per the change in the law the government made. If we need to reinstate the restricted leave policy in the future, we will similarly allow accrued leave to carry over if it can’t be taken.

The remainder of your holiday entitlement can then be booked and taken as per the holiday policy. If you have any questions, please speak to the HR team at [hr@qphl.co](mailto:hr@qphl.co).

Have a great bank holiday weekend, see you Monday.
