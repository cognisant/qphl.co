Dear all,

As we continue to make significant progress towards reducing COVID-19 infection rates both across the country and within our community, ongoing monitoring and evaluating of our internal mitigation measures is vital in establishing the safety and timing of our roll back plans.

As many of us have now received the COVID-19 vaccine we have an opportunity to assess, by testing, for the presence of antibodies to the virus. Antibody testing can also identify individuals who have contracted the virus but were asymptomatic.

We would like to offer our employees and their households/bubbles the opportunity to have an antibody test.

Employees who are onsite can have this antibody test when they have their scheduled surveillance tests. Those currently working from home, or your households/bubbles can attend one of our evening or Saturday morning clinics.

We will be holding clinics for households/bubbles and offsite workers on the following dates.

- Thursday 13th May from 17:00 to 19:00
- Friday 14th May from 17:00 to 19:00
- Saturday 15th May from 09:00 to 12:00
- Monday 17th May from 09:00 to 12:00
- Tuesday 18th May from 17:00 to 19:00

If you are on annual leave during the dates above, then alternative arrangements can be made.

These tests will take place in the COVID-19 cabin located in the A14/A15 yard and completed by our nursing team.

## How is the test performed?

The antibody test is a small finger prick blood test using a lancet. If you have a phobia of needles, then we can assure you that you will not see a needle during this test!

## What an antibody test can tell you?

The tests we have will detect IgG and IgM antibodies.

IgM antibodies are usually the first antibodies produced by your immune system when you are infected with a virus. A positive IgM test indicates that you may have been infected or that you have recently been vaccinated and your immune system has started responding to the vaccination.

IgG antibodies indicate that you received the vaccination or had the infection several weeks in the past.

## What does it mean if I receive a negative result?

A negative result means that the antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 or to the vaccine were not found in your blood sample. The reasons for this may include;

- You have only recently had the vaccine and it is too early to detect antibodies
- You have recently had the virus and it is too early to detect antibodies
- You had the virus several months ago and antibodies are no longer present
- Some health conditions make it difficult for your body to product antibodies to an infection or vaccination
- Whilst the test is 99% accurate in detecting antibodies you may receive a false negative result

An antibody test does not tell you:

- if you are immune to COVID-19
- if you can or cannot spread the virus to other people

**Action required by:**

- **Employees who are not attending site for surveillance tests**
