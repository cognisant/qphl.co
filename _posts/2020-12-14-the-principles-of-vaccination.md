How do our bodies fight infection? And how do vaccines help?

Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements in medicine and are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases. They can help protect us from diseases for which medication is not available. They have saved millions of lives all over the world, and continue to do so.

Crude vaccinations have been reported as far back as the 1500s in China, for protection against smallpox. The first laboratory vaccine was produced by Louis Pasteur in 1879, for chicken cholera. There is understandably a lot of discussion about vaccines at the moment, so watch this video to get your facts straight and help spread the word!
