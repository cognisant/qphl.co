Dear team,

As many of you will be aware, COVID-19 can, for some people, affect the amount of oxygen they are able to receive when breathing. There are medical devices available which can read your blood oxygen levels which can be used as a tool to monitor for any improvement or worsening of your condition.

As part of Our commitment to you we are pleased to share that we have secured a stock of blood oxygen monitors that we can issue to any employees for use either personally, within your household, or by a family member outside of your household, that have tested positive for COVID-19.

By regular use and recording of your measurements it can help guide you about what steps to take should you become more unwell for example, contacting a GP, calling NHS 111 or attending hospital.

We will hold these devices in all testing locations and with HR so whether you test positive on site or need one sent out to you we will be able to facilitate your needs. We will also provide written information on how to use these devices correctly and a record log and when you should seek additional medical guidance or help. HR will maintain a central record of who these devices have been issued to as they will then need to be returned once you or your family member has recovered, so they are available to issue to other people as they need them.
