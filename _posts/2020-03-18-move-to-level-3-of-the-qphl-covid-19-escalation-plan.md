title: Move to Level 3 of the QPHL COVID-19 escalation plan
category: QPHL communications

The Executive team have today moved the company from Level 2 to Level 3 of our QPHL COVID-19 Escalation Plan.

For those interested, we are using the Public Health England official data on reported cases, our own QPHL experience and Central Government Guidance which as I am sure you are all aware changed yesterday and we expect to evolve further. The exact details of the new actions to be taken are listed in the plan which is displayed in each café and is available at the link below.

These changes are an essential part of ensuring we can continue with the best possible service to the NHS at this challenging time. Our whole community needs the NHS right now and we are part of that.

## Home Working

Where people can work from home (i.e. can work fully and effectively, not just covering emails) and we have the equipment to provide for that we will - subject to them not having been redeployed to support a clinical/operational function. Those in a vulnerable category may be prioritised.

## Annual Leave

The following changes take immediate effect:

- All staff who are currently taking annual leave within this holiday year, in order not to lose it, can cancel it and roll over as much as they wish to next year. This is to increase capacity in the short term and facilitate maximum retraining, etc.
- All staff will be required to give a minimum of two months notice for an annual leave request. Exceptional cases may be accepted at the CEO’s discretion. This is to allow for greater short-term stability in our teams. I appreciate this might not be popular, but these are extraordinary times.

## Social Distancing

The social distancing measures announced by the government are pertinent to all of our activities both in and out of work. With regard to our workplace, our Level 3 activities are in alignment with the government’s guidance.

Social Distancing (people in vulnerable groups) - The government have said to people in certain categories that they should pay particular attention to social distancing measures. The guidance does not say people in those categories should not attend work. It suggests home working where that is possible (i.e. can work fully and effectively, not just covering emails) and where achievable we will prioritise these team members for working from home. If team members in this category are sufficiently concerned about this to decide not to attend work, then they should discuss this with HR, and it will be recorded as an authorised unpaid absence.

## Company Sick Pay

There is a dilemma faced by team members who have been with us for less than 6 months who have no access to company sick pay and rely on SSP alone. Where the guidance is to maybe stay at home, there is a financial incentive to come to work to ensure we can pay our bills, etc. We need people to responsibly follow that guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19 within “Our community” as part of maintaining as much capacity as we can. To facilitate this, and as part of “Our commitment to you”, we will make the following changes to the company sick pay scheme. With immediate effect we will extend the company sick pay scheme as follows:

- 0-3 months service – 1 week full pay, 1 week half pay
- 3-6 months service – 2 weeks full pay, 2 weeks half pay

This is a temporary change; we anticipate it will remain in effect during the delay phase of our response to COVID-19 (levels 3 to 5) but will remain subject to change. All other elements of the company sickness policy remain in place. You must go through the new reporting protocol with HR so we can have as clear a picture as is possible and enable us to support you as best we can.

## Communications

The situation is changing rapidly. Please access the website we have created to keep updated. ([qphl.co/coronavirus](https://qphl.co/coronavirus)) We will communicate an update to you:

- As a matter of course on Tuesdays.
- When the Executive team move us to a new level in our plan.
- When the Government guidance changes significantly.

The work we are doing is preparing us as best we can be for the spread of COVID-19 amongst us. There is an understandable gap in knowledge about this disease; it is, therefore, natural for us to feel anxious about the impact it will have on ourselves and our families. To date, there is reassuring evidence is that it will have little effect on most of us.

Finally, can I thank all of you for your efforts so far. We have a higher purpose as part of the response to COVID-19 that makes that effort worthwhile. It is bringing out the very best in us as we work to ensure we are a place “Where patients come first”.
